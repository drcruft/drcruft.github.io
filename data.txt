The word **“Charon”** comes from **Greek mythology**. Charon was the ferryman of Hades, responsible for transporting the souls of the dead across the river Styx (or Acheron) into the underworld. In myth, the dead had to pay him with a coin (often placed in their mouths at burial). Because of this role, Charon is strongly associated with **death, passage into the afterlife, and the boundary between the living and the dead**.

### Use in Cyber Threat Context

Adversaries often pick **mythological or symbolic names** for malware, exploits, or filename extensions to:

* **Signal intent or theme**: “Charon” evokes crossing into death or the underworld, suggesting the malware is a destructive “ferryman” that takes data or systems beyond recovery.
* **Intimidate or mislead defenders**: The name itself carries a sense of fear and inevitability, which can psychologically impact investigators.
* **Act as a marker or signature**: Certain ransomware groups or APTs use consistent naming schemes (e.g., Greek/Roman mythology) to label files, making attribution easier for researchers but also serving as a kind of “brand.”
* **Masquerade or obfuscate**: A custom extension like `.charon` may be applied to encrypted or exfiltrated files to indicate compromise, while also helping the attacker’s tooling identify which files are already processed.

### Significance of `.charon` as a File Extension

* **Ransomware**: If a ransomware strain renames encrypted files with `.charon`, the extension acts both as a victim identifier and a calling card. Victims immediately see the symbolic reminder of being “taken across the Styx” (i.e., their data is dead unless ransom is paid).
* **Exfiltration/Loader markers**: It could also be used by adversaries to mark staging files (e.g., data ready for exfiltration).
* **Thematic branding**: Groups sometimes use extensions like `.locky`, `.odin`, `.apollo`, etc. “Charon” fits into that mythological naming tradition.

✅ In short:

* **Charon (myth):** Ferryman of the dead → symbolizes transition to the underworld.
* **As file extension:** Used by adversaries to mark encrypted, staged, or compromised files; chosen for its ominous symbolism, intimidation factor, and branding value.

Would you like me to also check **recent threat intel reports** to see if a specific ransomware family or APT is currently using `.charon` as its extension? That way I can give you the exact actor and campaign details.


Here’s the latest threat-intel on **“.charon”** as a file extension:

* **What’s using it?** A **new ransomware family called *Charon*** appends the **`.Charon`** extension to encrypted files. The first observed campaign (published Aug 12–14, 2025) targeted **public-sector and aviation** orgs in the Middle East and used **APT-style tradecraft** (DLL sideloading, process injection, anti-EDR). Attribution is **not confirmed**, but researchers note overlap with tooling previously seen in **Earth Baxia** operations. ([Trend Micro][1]) ([BankInfoSecurity][2]) ([Dark Reading][3])

* **Concrete indicators (helpful for triage & hunting)**

  * Files get **`.Charon`** appended and contain an infection marker string: **`hCharon is enter to the urworld!`**. ([Trend Micro][1])
  * Ransom note filename excluded from encryption: **`How To Restore Your Files.txt`** (also avoids `.exe`, `.dll`, `.Charon`). ([Trend Micro][1])
  * Executed via **DLL sideloading**: a legitimate **`Edge.exe`** (cookie exporter) loads a malicious **`msedge.dll`** (“**SWORDLDR**”), which injects the payload into `svchost.exe`. ([Trend Micro][1])
  * Encrypted shellcode staged in a file named **`DumpStack.log`**. ([Trend Micro][1])
  * Mutex observed: **`OopsCharonHere`**. ([Trend Micro][1])
  * **Crypto:** hybrid **Curve25519 + ChaCha20** with a **72-byte footer** per file containing victim key/metadata. ([Trend Micro][1])

* **Operational picture**

  * Campaigns are **targeted (not spray-and-pray)** with **customized ransom notes** referencing the victim org. ([Trend Micro][1])
  * Multiple sources corroborate the use of the **`.Charon`** extension in these incidents. ([BankInfoSecurity][2])

* **So what’s the significance of using “Charon” as an extension?**
  It’s **branding + signaling**. “Charon” (the mythic **ferryman of the dead**) evokes data being “taken to the underworld,” while also acting as a **simple IOC** defenders can key on. But extensions are easy to change, so treat **`.Charon`** as **one clue among many** and confirm with the indicators above. ([BankInfoSecurity][2])

**Quick defender checklist (actionable):**

* Alert on **signed binaries** (e.g., `Edge.exe`) spawning **non-standard DLLs** like `msedge.dll` and then **`svchost.exe`**; watch for the **`DumpStack.log`** staging file. ([Trend Micro][1])
* Hunt for newly appended **`.Charon`** files and the marker string; scan for the **`OopsCharonHere`** mutex. ([Trend Micro][1])
* Expect **shadow-copy deletion** and service tampering; verify **offline/immutable backups**. ([Trend Micro][1])

If you want, I can turn this into a short **IOC sheet** (filenames, strings, process chain) you can hand to your SOC or plug into queries.
