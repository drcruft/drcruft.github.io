```python
This error is coming from vLLM‚Äôs pydantic-based `ModelConfig`, which by default bumps into Hugging Face‚Äôs repo-ID validator. In your `./model/llmembedding/config.json` you have something like:

```json
{
  "repo_id": "./model/llmembedding",
  ‚Ä¶
}
```

but the validator insists that a ‚Äúrepo\_id‚Äù be either

* a bare name (e.g. `"gpt2"`) or
* a namespace/repo pair (e.g. `"BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5"`),

so it rejects anything starting with `./`.

---

### üîß Fix A: Patch your `config.json`

1. Open `./model/llmembedding/config.json`.
2. Change the `repo_id` entry to a valid Hugging Face model ID. For example, if you originally tensorized **BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5**, set:

   ```json
   {
     "repo_id": "BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5",
     "revision": "main",
     ‚Ä¶
   }
   ```
3. Save and restart vLLM.

This will satisfy the pydantic check and allow the model to load.

### üîß Fix B: Re-tensorize with the proper `--repo-id`

If you‚Äôre using the `tensorize_vllm_model.py` script, you can tell it the correct repo name at generation time instead of the local path:

```bash
python examples/others/tensorize_vllm_model.py \
  --model-id    BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5 \
  --repo-id     BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5 \
  --output-dir  ./model/llmembedding \
  --dtype       float16
```

That way your `config.json` is baked with a valid `"repo_id"` from the start.

---

### üîß Fix C: Skip tensorization and serve directly from the Hub

If you don‚Äôt actually need a tensorized snapshot on disk, you can just point vLLM at the model on HF:

```bash
vllm serve --model BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5 --port 8000
```

This will pull the model config and weights straight from the Hub, bypassing any local-path validation altogether.

---

#### Why this happens

Hugging Face‚Äôs `hf_hub_download` and related validators treat any string you pass as a ‚Äúrepo\_id‚Äù unless you explicitly give it a registered namespace/model name. Paths beginning with `./` or `/` aren‚Äôt accepted by the validator ([Hugging Face][1]) ‚Äî they only allow alphanumerics, `-`, `_`, and a single `/` between namespace and repo([GitHub][2]).

Pick the approach that best fits your workflow‚Äîeither correct the repo ID in your config, re-tensorize with the right name, or serve directly from the Hub.
