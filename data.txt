**Position Title:**
Data Engineer, Cybersecurity AI Solutions

---

## 1. Position Description

The Data Engineer on the Cybersecurity AI Solutions team will architect, build, and operationalize the end-to-end data pipelines that power our next-generation AI-driven security analytics. Reporting to the Head of Cybersecurity AI, you will partner closely with data scientists, security analysts, and IT infrastructure teams to ingest, process, and curate massive, heterogeneous data sets—log data from Splunk, telemetry from network devices, threat intelligence feeds, and GPU-accelerated ML outputs. You will design scalable, highly available data platforms on Cloudera and NVIDIA Superpod clusters, enforce data quality via Cribble, and integrate outputs into Splunk Enterprise Security and SOAR workflows. Your work will enable real-time threat detection, automated response orchestration, and continuous model retraining, directly strengthening Saudi Aramco’s security posture.
