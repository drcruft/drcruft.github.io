Certainly. Here are **5 key risks and challenges** faced by a SOC that **has not adopted cognitive AI capabilities**:

---

### 1. **Alert Fatigue and Missed Threats**

* Overwhelmed analysts may ignore or overlook critical alerts due to high volumes and false positives, increasing the risk of undetected breaches.

---

### 2. **Slow Detection and Response Times**

* Without AI-driven correlation and triage, threat detection and incident response are slower, leading to prolonged attacker dwell time and higher impact.

---

### 3. **Scalability Bottlenecks**

* Manual processes and human-limited workflows cannot scale with growing data, endpoints, and threat complexity, especially during surge events.

---

### 4. **Inconsistent Decision-Making**

* Decisions vary across analysts based on experience, fatigue, or cognitive bias, leading to errors, duplicated effort, or delayed action.

---

### 5. **Inefficient Use of Human Resources**

* Highly skilled analysts spend time on repetitive, low-value tasks (e.g., log reviews, ticket writing) instead of proactive threat hunting or investigation.
